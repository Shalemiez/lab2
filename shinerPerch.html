                <p><strong>Family:</strong>
                    Embiotocidae (Surfperches)</p><br>

                <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                    The body of the silver surfperch is oval and strongly compressed. The head is small and the mouth is
                    moderately large. The body is silvery with dusky (brownish to gray) coloration on the back and dusky
                    bars on the sides. The tail is usually pink with an occasional orange spot on the anal fin. The
                    specific name ellipticum refers to its elliptical body out- line. It looks similar to the walleye
                    surfperch but lacks the silver coloration on its pelvic fins.</p><br>
