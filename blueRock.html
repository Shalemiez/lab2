                <h2 id="blue">Blue Rockfish</h2> <br>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Scorpaenidae (Scorpionfishes)
                </p><br>


                <p><strong>Description:</strong> <br>The body of the blue rockfish is oval or egg-shaped and compressed
                    with
                    similar dorsal and ventral profiles. The head is relatively short and bluntly pointed. The mouth is
                    relatively small with the lower jaw slightly projecting. The color is dark blue or olive brown to
                    grayish black on the back becoming lighter below; blotched with lighter shades on back and sides.
                    The presence of five spines on the preopercle (gill cover), easily distinguish this species as a
                    rockfish rather than a perch, a bass or a halfmoon which is of similar color. The black rockfish can
                    be confused with this species; however, the black rockfish has spots on the dorsal fin while the
                    blue rockfish does not. The anal fin of the black rockfish is rounded while that of the blue
                    rockfish is slanted or straight.
                </p><br>

                <p><strong>Fishing Information:</strong> <br>Blue rockfish can be caught in quantity near rocky shores
                    and
                    around breakwaters, sunken ships, piles of rubble and similar localities along the entire California
                    coastline, especially north of Point Conception. They are caught just beneath the surface in and
                    around kelp beds, but where there is no kelp they live mostly near the bottom. Almost any kind of
                    cut fish will prove productive bait. Mussel, clam, crab, shrimp and squid strips work almost equally
                    as well, as do some kinds of wet flies and other artificial lures. Blue rockfish are noted for
                    putting up an excellent battle when hooked. Conservation methods (seasons, hooks, depth) for
                    rockfish vary by area, so be sure to check the current regulations before going out.
